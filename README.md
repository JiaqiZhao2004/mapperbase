# Mapper Base
 A base mod for my Minecraft mods.
 
 This is a small mod that adds contents used by my other mods. This is to avoid duplicating elements between my other mods.
 By itself this mod only adds a few contents, usually without any explicit usage so it is not a mod meant to be installed alone. It is best used with my other mods:
 
 EmbellishCraft: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/embellishcraft  
 Road Stuff 2: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/road-stuff
 
 Targeted Minecraft version: 1.20  
 Mod loader: Forge
